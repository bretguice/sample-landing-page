I created a sample landing page based off a sample design from the Odin Project.  I had to create the html file first and then add in the stylesheets.  In this project I have a header and footer, different colored sections and text.  I decided to implement in the Odin Projects sample color scheme as variables in my the root to make it easier to call the different colors throughout the stylesheet.
